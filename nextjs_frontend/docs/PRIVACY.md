# Privacy Policy (Template)

Last updated: {{DATE}}

This frontend prioritizes privacy by design. It minimizes data storage and provides controls for consent and cookies.

What we collect (frontend perspective):
- Messages typed in the chat (sent to backend when integrated).
- Uploaded file metadata (names and sizes) in this mock; real uploads will stream directly to the backend.
- Optional analytics events (only if consent is granted and cookies are accepted).

Controls:
- Cookie Banner: choose essential-only cookies or accept all.
- Consent Modal: consent for analytics/processing before chat use (configurable).
- Data Export/Deletion: to be supported via backend endpoints.

Retention:
- The frontend stores only minimal preferences in localStorage via a safe wrapper (consent, cookies).
- All long-term storage will occur in the backend per institutional policy.

Note: Replace this template with your organization’s official policy before production.
